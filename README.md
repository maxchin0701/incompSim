# LTREB Incompatibility Simulations

Forward time simulations in Admixem investigating interactions between incompatibility selection and various models of mate choice.

*Directory structure*
simulation_files: raw simulation files for running in Admixem, organized by mate choice model
outputs: raw outputs for simulations, also organized by mate choice model into subdirectories. Under each subdirectory, you will find four .csv files. 
      RawGeno: Raw genotypes for all individuals
      Phenotypes: Phenotypes (genome wide percent heterozygosity and malinche ancestry) for all individuals
      Fis: Fis statistics for each replicate-population-generation combination, calculated based solely on the              incompatibility locus
      Ho: Heterozygosity for each replicate-population-generation combination, calculated based solely on the              incompatibility locus
